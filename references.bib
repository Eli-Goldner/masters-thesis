This chapter focuses on the main themes and technical contributions of situation theory. Linguists were encouraged to provide semantic analyses that used whatever entities they needed, without worrying too much about the technical matter of the way such entities should be modeled. The linguistic project became to be known as “situation semantics” and the logical project was called “situation theory.” Situation theory was intended to stand to situation semantics as type. Situation theory stands to Montague grammar. In any foundational study, one has to decide whether to build models or theories. The strategies are distinct if not divergent, and the ideal of a canonical theory is rarely achieved. The chapter introduces the class of simple information structures. Structures in this class are intended to provide a naive model of the structure of information, as captured by the relational structures of first-order model theory. The class is axiomatized, and each of the axioms is discussed in the chapter with a view to generalization. Many of the novelties of situation theory can be seen as generalizations of this sort.}

We start from the treatment of anaphoric accessibility developed in discourse representation theory (DRT), and we show first how to obtain a discourse model that, while preserving DRT's basic ideas about referential accessibility, includes information about the occurrence of speech acts and their relations. Next, we show how the different kinds of ‘structure’ that play a role in conversation—discourse segmentation, turn-taking, and grounding—can be formulated in terms of information about speech acts, and use this same information as the basis for a model of the interpretation of fragmentary input.},

The resulting representation, which we call {``}Uniform Meaning Representation{''} (UMR), adopts the predicative core of AMR and embeds it under a {``}scope{''} graph when appropriate. UMR representations differ from other treatments of quantification and modal scope phenomena in two ways: (a) they are more transparent; and (b) they specify default scope when possible.{`}",

This is a natural extension of AMR{'}s original design principles, allowing us to easily model basic projection phenomena such as quantification and negation as well as complex phenomena such as bound variables and donkey anaphora.",

In this article, we give four different tableau-based decision procedures for a very expressive hybrid logic including the universal modality; three of the procedures are based on different tableau systems, and one procedure is based on a Gentzen system. The decision procedures make use of so-called loop-checks, which is a standard technique used in connection with tableau systems for other logics, namely, prefixed tableau systems for transitive modal logics as well as for certain description logics. The loop-checks used in our four decision procedures are similar, but the four proof systems on which the procedures are based constitute a spectrum of different systems: prefixed and internalized systems, tableau and Gentzen systems.}",

abstract = {Hybrid logic is a formalism that is closely related to both modal logic and description logic. A variety of proof mechanisms for hybrid logic exist, but the only widely available implemented proof system, HyLoRes, is based on the resolution method. An alternative to resolution is the tableaux method, already widely used for both modal and description logics. Tableaux algorithms have also been developed for a number of hybrid logics, and the goal of the present work is to implement one of them. In this article we present the implementation of a terminating tableaux algorithm for the hybrid logic H(@,A). The performance of the tableaux algorithm is compared with the performances of HyLoRes, HyLoTab (a system based on a different tableaux algorithm) and RacerPro. HTab is written in the functional language Haskell, using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).

Many aspects of OWL have been thoroughly reengineered in OWL 2, thus producing a robust platform for future development of the language.}

abstract="This is a system description of the Description Logic reasoner FaCT++. The reasoner implements a tableaux decision procedure for the well known {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}SHOIQ{\}}{\$}description logic, with additional support for datatypes, including strings and integers. The system employs a wide range of performance enhancing optimisations, including both standard techniques (such as absorption and model merging) and newly developed ones (such as ordering heuristics and taxonomic classification). FaCT++ can, via the standard DIG interface, be used to provide reasoning services for ontology engineering tools supporting the OWL DL ontology language.",

abstractNote={In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the NLP community in genuine language understanding and dialogue. Thus the long-standing issue of how the semantic content of language should be represented is reentering the communal discussion. This paper provides a brief “opinionated survey” of broad-coverage semantic representation (SR). It suggests multiple desiderata for such representations, and then outlines more than a dozen approaches to SR-some longstanding, and some more recent, providing quick characterizations, pros, cons, and some comments on implementations.},

    abstract = "Generating {``}commonsense{'}{'} knowledge for intelligent understanding and reasoning is a difficult, long-standing problem, whose scale challenges the capacity of any approach driven primarily by human input. Furthermore, approaches based on mining statistically repetitive patterns fail to produce the rich representations humans acquire, and fall far short of human efficiency in inducing knowledge from text. The idea of our approach to this problem is to provide a learning system with a {``}head start{''} consisting of a semantic parser, some basic ontological knowledge, and most importantly, a small set of very general schemas about the kinds of patterns of events (often purposive, causal, or socially conventional) that even a one- or two-year-old could reasonably be presumed to possess. We match these initial schemas to simple children{'}s stories, obtaining concrete instances, and combining and abstracting these into new candidate schemas. Both the initial and generated schemas are specified using a rich, expressive logical form. While modern approaches to schema reasoning often only use slot-and-filler structures, this logical form allows us to specify complex relations and constraints over the slots. Though formal, the representations are language-like, and as such readily relatable to NL text. The agents, objects, and other roles in the schemas are represented by typed variables, and the event variables can be related through partial temporal ordering and causal relations. To match natural language stories with existing schemas, we first parse the stories into an underspecified variant of the logical form used by the schemas, which is suitable for most concrete stories. We include a walkthrough of matching a children{'}s story to these schemas and generating inferences from these matches.",

    abstract = "Abstract Unscoped episodic logical form (ULF) is a semantic representation capturing the predicate-argument structure of English within the episodic logic formalism in relation to the syntactic structure, while leaving scope, word sense, and anaphora unresolved. We describe how ULF can be used to generate natural language inferences that are grounded in the semantic and syntactic structure through a small set of rules defined over interpretable predicates and transformations on ULFs. The semantic restrictions placed by ULF semantic types enables us to ensure that the inferred structures are semantically coherent while the nearness to syntax enables accurate mapping to English. We demonstrate these inferences on four classes of conversationally-oriented inferences in a mixed genre dataset with 68.5{\%} precision from human judgments.",
