\title{Formalization of AMR Inference via Hybrid Logic Tableaux}
 

 
\author{

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

  AMR and its extensions have become popular in semantic representation due
  to their ease of annotation by non-experts and
  attention to the predicative core of sentences, abstracting away from syntactic differences.
  An area where AMR and its extensions warrant improvement is formalization
  and suitability for inference, where it is lacking compared to
  other semantic/knowledge representations such as
  description logics, episodic logic, and discourse representation theory.
  This thesis presents a formalization of inference over AMR variants annotated for tense and aspect
  along with quantification and scope, via Blackburn and Marx's tableaux method for quantified hybrid
  logic, and Blackburn and Jørgensen's tableux method for indexical hybrid tense logic.
  Hybrid logic's nominals are used to handle tense (and non-habitual aspect) in AMR via Blackburn's
  treatment of Reichenbach tenses for hybrid logic. Quantification, negation, and modality are
  handled natively in quantified hybrid logic.  We motivate the merging of these AMR variants,
  present their interpretation and inference in the combined quantified hybrid logic
  and indexical hybrid tense logic, and demonstrate the soundess, completeness,
  and decidability of the combined logics.

\section{AMR with Scope, Tense and Aspect, to Hybrid Logic}
\subsection{Design Decisions}

Since to my knowledge there's no precedent in either of the adopted AMR
annotations, UMR, or in the hybrid logic literature
for the ways quantification optimally interacts with time,
one option is to take quantification to be eternalist, i.e.
all quantification will be over entities in the entire domain of discourse
as opposed to different entities which exist at particular times throughout the discourse.
The other option is to use presentist quanitification, which indexes the domain of discourse
over times/nominals, so quanitification is done over entities which exist at that time.  
One motivator to use eternalist quanitification is that given the root node will either be \verb|scope| or a logical connective,
there is no way within the combination of AMR annotations (or UMR) to ensure the  

\subsection{Extraction Steps}
With the chosen annotation the root node
can consist of either a logical connective
(\verb|and|, \verb|or|, or \verb|cond|) linking two
AMR graphs, or a \verb|scope| node with its following
predicate and arguments.
